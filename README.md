# Shop tools

## It's live!

You can check it out on [github pages](https://zummek.github.io/shop-tools/).

## Description

This is a simple and _quick_ project that allows to save time/money on some repetitive tasks. So I didn't care about the code quality, I just wanted to get it done.

## Deployment

It uses Github Pages to deploy the app. The deployment is done automatically when a new commit is pushed to the `main` branch.
